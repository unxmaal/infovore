# infovore

## Purpose

## Architecture

## Data model

## Configuration

## Running

## Grouping rules

## Extraction prompt

## Privacy and opt-out

## Coverage exclusions

- `...` bodies: Protocol method stubs have no executable behavior; they define shapes that implementations are tested against.
- `if TYPE_CHECKING:` blocks: imports needed only by the type checker never run at runtime.

## Consuming the database

## Deployment

## Development workflow

```
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
```

Every change is red/green TDD on a feature branch named `<issue>-<slug>`, opened as a PR that references its issue. Coverage is enforced at 100% line and branch.

Import boundaries are enforced by ruff `banned-api`: `discord` only in `infovore/source/live.py`, process spawning only in `infovore/llm/claude_cli.py`, `openai`/`httpx` only in `infovore/llm/openai_compat.py`.
